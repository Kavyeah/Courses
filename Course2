Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

D S kavya.
Divide and Conquer Algorithms
This technique can be divided into the following three parts:

Divide: This involves dividing the problem into smaller sub-problems.
Conquer: Solve sub-problems by calling recursively until solved.
Combine: Combine the sub-problems to get the final solution of the whole problem.
